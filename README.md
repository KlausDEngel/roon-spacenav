# roon-spacenav
A volume control Roon extension for the SpaceNavigator space mouse. Rotating the knob will change the volume, right button will skip to next track and left button will skip to previous track. It also works on Raspberry Pi, so the SpaceNavigator can be connected to the Pi directly. It is tested with the USB SpaceNavigator. Other device compatibility is not guaranteed.
